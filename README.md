What is a HomeLab in I.T. / Cybersecurity?

A homelab is an environment meant to simulate components of I.T. infrastructure, equipment, and configurations similar to a business or enterprise network.
The goal of a homelab is to understand the process of installing, configuring, and optimizing I.T. infrastructure at a relatively small scale so one can apply similar processes to a real-world business or enterprise network.
Homelabs range in complexity, some being completely virtualized while others have incorporated hardware. Although homelabs can appear to be complex and perhaps overwhelming to the beginner, they are relatively easy to outline with proper clarity. 

For this cybersecurity homelab project, I will be building and simulating a business network with different components including:

Upgrading physical PC equipment (RAM and Hard drive) 
Installing Windows 10 image
Setting up VMware Workstation 15 Player
Configuring and working with Active Directory
Setting up and connecting Linux Desktop and Windows 10 pro (enterprise) VM images to AD
Configuring and securing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
Setting up and working with Palo Alto PAN-OS 8
Setting up and working with the open source PF sense firewall
Building a small-scale VPN server (using OpenVPN)
Configuring a vulnerability scanner (Nessus) and simulating vulnerability scans
Configuring a System Information Event Management System (SIEM) with Splunk and logging events
Possibly more
